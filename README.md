# HackU-FacU: CLC Guardian

## The Problem
1. How do we track learners at CLC events, capture demographic data and measure impact of these events?

## Overview
The CLC guardian is a platform for parents to participate in the learning of their children in Code-Mobile workshops. This project aims to allow guardians to follow along with their children's learning goals and achievments in the code-mobile workshops while providing required demographic data about their children to CLC.
